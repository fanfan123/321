      A prized edible species, found in broadleaved and mixed woodland. Forms (mycorrhizal) association with the tree roots. One of the sponge caps with pores in place of gills on its lower surface.

    <p>
      Highly toxic, a quarter of a cap kills very unpleasantly - but not slugs! Most of the Amanita family are poisonous. Learn to recognise these fungi if you collect for the table. Found under oak, with which it forms a (mycorrhizal) association.

    <p>
      Brilliant yellow, with salmon-orange tones. Grows on trunks of living trees, mainly oak and chestnut, and also even on Yew*, causing hert rots. Edible, and prized in USA, but can cause gastro-intestinal upsets.

  <h3>THIMBLE MOREL VERPA CONICA</h3>

    <p>
      Quite rare and confined to hawthorn scrub on chalk. There is much of this in Mole Valey, and 2004 was a good year for this small and elusive  spring species. An ascomycete with a hollow stem.
